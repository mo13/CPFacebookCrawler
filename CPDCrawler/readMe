this will create the files:
			The outer mysite/ directory is just a
			container for your project. Its name doesn’t
			matter to Django; you can rename it to anything
			you like. manage.py: A command-line utility
			that lets you interact with this Django project
			in various ways. You can read all the details
			about manage.py in django-admin.py and
			manage.py. The inner mysite/ directory is the
			actual Python package for your project. Its
			name is the Python package name you’ll need to
			use to import anything inside it (e.g. import
			mysite.settings). mysite/__init__.py: An empty
			file that tells Python that this directory
			should be considered a Python package. (Read
			more about packages in the official Python docs
			if you’re a Python beginner.)
			mysite/settings.py: Settings/configuration for
			this Django project. Django settings will tell
			you all about how settings work.
			mysite/urls.py: The URL declarations for this
			Django project; a “table of contents” of your
			Django-powered site. You can read more about
			URLs in URL dispatcher. mysite/wsgi.py: An
			entry-point for WSGI-compatible webservers to
			serve your project. See How to deploy with WSGI
			for more details.
check to see if the project ran. in the mysite directory run
	$ python manage.py runserver
you should see
